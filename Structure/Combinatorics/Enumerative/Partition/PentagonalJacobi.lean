# Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem and Jacobi's Triple Product Identity

This file formalizes Euler's pentagonal number theorem and Jacobi's triple product identity,
following the treatment in the AlgebraicCombinatorics textbook.

## Main definitions

* `pentagonalNumber` : The k-th pentagonal number w_k = (3k - 1) * k / 2
* `Level` : A "level" is a half-integer p + 1/2 for some integer p (used in the proof)
* `State` : A "state" is a set of levels containing all but finitely many negative levels
  and only finitely many positive levels
* `State.energy` : The energy of a state
* `State.parnum` : The particle number of a state

## Main results

* `pentagonalNumber_nonneg` : Pentagonal numbers are nonnegative
* `euler_pentagonal_number_theorem` : ∏_{k≥1} (1 - x^k) = ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k x^{w_k}
* `jacobi_triple_product` : Jacobi's triple product identity
* `partition_recursive` : Recursive formula for partition numbers using pentagonal numbers
* `euler_sum_divisors_recursive` : Euler's recursion for the sum of divisors function

/-- A "state" is a set of levels that contains all but finitely many negative levels
and only finitely many positive levels.

This is used in Borcherds' proof of Jacobi's triple product identity.

**Important convention**: A "level" in the tex source is a half-integer `p + 1/2` for some integer p.
We represent it by the integer p. Thus:
- "positive level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 > 0`, i.e., `p ≥ 0` in our representation
- "negative level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 < 0`, i.e., `p < 0` in our representation

The structure tracks:
- `finite_nonneg`: the set of nonnegative integers p (representing positive half-integer levels) in S
- `finite_negative_missing`: the set of negative integers p (representing negative half-integer levels) NOT in S -/

  /-- Only finitely many nonnegative levels (p ≥ 0, representing positive half-integers p+1/2 > 0) are in the state -/

  /-- Only finitely many negative levels (p < 0, representing negative half-integers p+1/2 < 0) are NOT in the state -/
  finite_negative_missing : Set.Finite {p : Level | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ levels}
