# `sortslice` model and movement primitives

CPython stores keys and optional payload values in parallel pointer arrays.
The Lean model stores their observable pairing as one entry, so every movement
primitive moves a key and its payload atomically.  Integer indices replace raw
pointers.  Failed bounds checks are explicit through `Option`; later safety
proofs establish that transcribed calls return `some`.

`memmove` carries explicit backing provenance.  On one shared store it chooses
its traversal direction from the overlap geometry: a rightward overlapping
move copies from the end, while a leftward move copies from the beginning, so
unread source entries are never overwritten.  A distinct backing instead uses
the source-language's forward two-store copy order, even when its contents
happen to equal the destination.  `memcpy` uses the same provenance distinction
but rejects overlapping same-backing ranges.
