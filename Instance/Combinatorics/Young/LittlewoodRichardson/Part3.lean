# The Littlewood-Richardson Rule

This file formalizes the Littlewood-Richardson rule for Schur polynomials, following
the presentation in the Algebraic Combinatorics textbook.

The Littlewood-Richardson rule is one of the most famous results in the theory of symmetric
polynomials. It provides a combinatorial formula for expanding the product of Schur polynomials
as a sum of Schur polynomials:
$$s_\nu \cdot s_{\lambda/\mu} = \sum_{T} s_{\nu + \operatorname{cont}(T)}$$
where the sum is over all ν-Yamanouchi semistandard tableaux T of shape λ/μ.

## Main definitions

* `NPartition`: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of natural numbers
* `contentTableau`: The content of a tableau (counting occurrences of each entry)
* `colGeq`: Restriction of a tableau to columns ≥ j
* `IsYamanouchi`: A semistandard tableau is ν-Yamanouchi if certain conditions hold
* `alternant`: The alternant polynomial a_α
* `schurPoly`: The Schur polynomial s_λ (via the Jacobi-Trudi formula)
* `skewSchurPoly`: The skew Schur polynomial s_{λ/μ}

## Main results

* `littlewoodRichardson`: Zelevinsky's generalized Littlewood-Richardson rule (thm.sf.lr-zy)
* `stembridgeLemma`: Stembridge's lemma (lem.sf.stemb-lem)
* `schurPoly_eq_alternant_div`: Theorem relating Schur polynomials to alternants (thm.sf.schur-symm (b))

## Indexing Convention

**This file uses 1-indexed columns** for skew Young diagrams, matching the textbook convention:
- A cell (i, j) is in Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i < j ≤ λ_i
- Column indices start at 1 (the first column is j = 1)

This differs from `SchurBasics.lean` which uses **0-indexed columns** (Mathlib convention):
- A cell (i, j) is in Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i ≤ j < λ_i
- Column indices start at 0 (the first column is j = 0)

The bijection (i, j) ↔ (i, j+1) converts between the conventions.
See `SchurBasics.skewCellEquiv` and `SchurBasics.mem_skewYoungDiagram_iff_mem_LR_shifted`
for explicit equivalences.

/-! ## Finiteness of tableaux

The set of semistandard tableaux of any fixed shape is finite, since entries are bounded
by N and the shape is finite. Similarly, the set of Yamanouchi tableaux is finite. -/
