# Analysis I, Section 5.6: Real exponentiation, part I

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text.  When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Exponentiating reals to natural numbers and integers.
- nth roots.
- Raising a real to a rational number.
