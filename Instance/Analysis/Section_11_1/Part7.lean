# Analysis I, Section 11.1: Partitions

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Bounded intervals and partitions.
- Length of an interval; the lengths of a partition sum to the length of the interval.

  mem P J := J ∈ P.intervals

  bot := {
    intervals := {I}

    contains := by grind [subset_iff]
    }
