# Analysis I, Section 8.5: Ordered sets

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Review of {name}`PartialOrder`, {name}`LinearOrder`, and {name}`WellFoundedLT`, with some API.
- Strong induction.
- Zorn's lemma.

/-- Exercise 8.5.16: The set of partial orderings on X, ordered by "coarser than",
is itself a partial order. -/

  le p1 p2 := ∀ x y : X, p1.le x y → p2.le x y
