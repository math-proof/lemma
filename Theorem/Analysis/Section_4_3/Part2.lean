  Definition 4.3.2 (Distance).
  We avoid the Mathlib notion of distance here because it is real-valued.

theorem dist_eq (x y: ℚ) : dist x y = |x-y| := rfl

  Definition 4.3.4 (eps-closeness).  In the text the notion is undefined for ε zero or negative,
  but it is more convenient in Lean to assign a "junk" definition in this case.  But this also
  allows some relaxations of hypotheses in the lemmas that follow.

theorem close_iff (ε x y:ℚ): ε.Close x y ↔ |x - y| ≤ ε := by rfl
