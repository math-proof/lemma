# Analysis I, Section 4.2

This file is a translation of Section 4.2 of Analysis I to Lean 4.
All numbering refers to the original text.

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Definition of the "Section 4.2" rationals, `Section_4_2.Rat`, as formal quotients `a // b` of
  integers `a b:ℤ`, up to equivalence.  (This is a quotient of a scaffolding type
  `Section_4_2.PreRat`, which consists of formal quotients without any equivalence imposed.)

- Field operations and order on these rationals, as well as an embedding of {lean}`ℕ` and {lean}`ℤ`.

- Equivalence with the Mathlib rationals {name}`_root_.Rat` (or {lean}`ℚ`), which we will use going forward.

Note: here (and in the sequel) we use Mathlib's natural numbers {lean}`ℕ` and integers {lean}`ℤ` rather than
the Chapter 2 natural numbers and Section 4.1 integers.
