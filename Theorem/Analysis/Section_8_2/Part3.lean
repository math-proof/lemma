# Analysis I, Section 8.2: Summation on infinite sets

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Absolute convergence and summation on countably infinite or general sets.
- Connections with Mathlib's {name}`Summable` and {name}`tsum`.
- The Riemann rearrangement theorem.

Some non-trivial API is provided beyond what is given in the textbook in order connect these
notions with existing summation notions.

After this section, the summation notation developed here will be deprecated in favor of Mathlib's API for {name}`Summable` and {name}`tsum`.
