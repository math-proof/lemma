# Analysis I, Section 3.5: Cartesian products

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Ordered pairs and n-tuples.
- Cartesian products and n-fold products.
- Finite choice.
- Connections with Mathlib counterparts such as {name}`Set.pi` and {name}`Set.prod`.
