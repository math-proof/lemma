# Analysis I, Section 4.1: The integers

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Definition of the "Section 4.1" integers, `Section_4_1.Int`, as formal differences `a —— b` of
  natural numbers `a b:ℕ`, up to equivalence.  (This is a quotient of a scaffolding type
  `Section_4_1.PreInt`, which consists of formal differences without any equivalence imposed.)

- ring operations and order these integers, as well as an embedding of {lean}`ℕ`.

- Equivalence with the Mathlib integers {name}`_root_.Int` (or {lean}`ℤ`), which we will use going forward.
