# Analysis I, Section 11.9: The two fundamental theorems of calculus

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the
original text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a
more faithful translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will
be places where the Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I
have consciously avoided doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:
- The fundamental theorems of calculus.
