# Analysis I, Chapter 5 epilogue: Isomorphism with the Mathlib real numbers

In this (technical) epilogue, we show that the "Chapter 5" real numbers {name}`Chapter5.Real` are
isomorphic in various standard senses to the standard real numbers {lean}`ℝ`.  This we do by matching
both structures with Dedekind cuts of the (Mathlib) rational numbers {lean}`ℚ`.

From this point onwards, {name}`Chapter5.Real` will be deprecated, and we will use the standard real
numbers {lean}`ℝ` instead.  In particular, one should use the full Mathlib API for {lean}`ℝ` for all
subsequent chapters, in lieu of the {name}`Chapter5.Real` API.

Filling the {syntax term}`sorry`s here requires both the {name}`Chapter5.Real` API and the Mathlib API for the standard
real numbers {lean}`ℝ`.  As such, they are excellent exercises to prepare you for the aforementioned
transition.
