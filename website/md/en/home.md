# What is lemma.cn
  <br>
  
[lemma.cn](../index.php) is a website for symbolic	semi-mechanized axiomatized theorem-proving system, consisting of two versions written respectively in Python and Lean language. The [Python](../../py/website/index.php) version is based on open-source symbolic computation project of [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) and 
[Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net), its main terminology is defined according to the naming conventions of the commercial algebraic system 
[Mathematica](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/index.html.en?source=footer). The [Lean](https://github.com/math-proof/lemma/tree/main) version is translated from the Python version. It's main ideals are: semi-mechanization, axiomatization, and the pursuit of logic correctness. At present, it can be used in conducting semi-automatic proving for theorems from mathematics textbook.  

* the above-mentioned semi-mechanization is so defined that:   
at present, we can't devise a fully-automatic machine to process human-like logic reasoning steps in theorem-proving according the given prerequisites and conclusions.  
The machine can only solve the mathematical problem according the instruction provided by humans. Humans must tell the computer by searching through the axiom knowledge bank, what theorems or axioms to apply in front of a given mathematical problem. 
* the above-mentioned axiomatization is so defined that:  
every mathematical theorem, in the final analysis, can be proved by axioms which are unprovable, which are assumed self-evident, whose correctness is hypothesized by humans to hold true.  
The whole mathematical theorem knowledge bank is built step by step on these presumably true hypotheses.

* the above-mentioned pursuit of logic correctness is so defined that:  
during the processing of conducting reasoning, in accordance with the statements defined in 
[Hilbert's program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program), the program strives to be logically valid within the grammars defined by [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language).   
Each theorem is proved according to the assumptions and correctness of some previously proved theorems or axioms. In this project, each mathematical problem will be expressed as a [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) statement which is precisely defined with no ambiguity which can emerge when one use natural language to express a mathematical problem, such as evidently/conspicuously, likewise, equivalently, conversely, in summary/put it in a nutshell.   
One can easily locate the website information in the Google search engine: [定理库](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86%E5%BA%93).  
In the open-source community, other automatic thoerem libraries include: [leanprover](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Algebra/Basic.html), [coq](https://github.com/coq/coq) and [isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

# The construction of Mathematical Theorem Repertoire
  <br>
  
As of this writing, <label id=count>____</label> theorems have been recored in the theorem repertoire, which can be applied in semi-mechanized axiomatized system of mathematical theorem proving.  
It is mainly comprising of :  	
	
* [Nat](../?module=Nat) Elementary algebra related to natural numbers  
* [Int](../?module=Int) Elementary algebra related to integers  
* [Rat](../?module=Rat) Elementary algebra related to rational numbers  
* [Real](../?module=Real) Algebra and real analysis related to real numbers  
* [Hyperreal](../?module=Real) Algebra related to hyperreal numbers  
* [Complex](../?module=Real) Algebra and complex analysis related to complex numbers  
* [Set](../?module=Set) Set theory  
* [Finset](../?module=Set) Finite set theory

This newly emerged semi-mechanized axiomatized theorem-proving system can simplify reasoning steps in mathematical analysis, thus achieving the ideal of "plugging in the dynamos of thinking". The researcher need only master the macro skeleton of reasoning, leaving the detailed computation to computer. It can be applied for theoretical mathematical proving, which can be useful in providing reference or guidance during the course of mathematical analysis for algorithm engineers, researcher in their research work. It can also be used for mathematical researchers to manage and edit their theoretical papers, without the need of manual editing of mathematical formulae since the latex printing is automatically generated by programming. One Can even use the on-line Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to edit the mathematical theorems to finish theoretical research work. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to locate the definition of any symbol or function instantly. It is of practical use for theoretical research, industrial research or pedagogical purposes. It is a mathematical textbook written in Lean4 Language, as well as an on-line reference book for both mathematical theorems and algorithmic models for industry.
