# Topology induced by an absolute value

This module ports ATLAS `NumberTheoryI` N176 / Corollary 8.6.
Given an absolute value `v` on a field `K`, the carrier map
`WithAbs.toAbs v : K → WithAbs v` pulls the norm topology on `WithAbs v`
back to `K`. The main theorem characterizes equality of these carrier
topologies, not equality of absolute values: two absolute values induce
the same topology on `K` if and only if they are equivalent.

This is about equality of the induced topologies on `K`, not about equality

on many elements while inducing different topologies. -/
