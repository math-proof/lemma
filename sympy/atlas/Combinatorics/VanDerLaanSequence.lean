lines 92-96).

The source calls a non-negative sequence Van der Laan when, for every four
consecutive terms, the largest term equals the sum of the two smallest
(conjecture from the OEIS entry; only the predicate is formalized here).
This is a faithful total definition on naturals: the largest of four values
is their iterated `max`, and the sum of the two smallest is the minimum of
the six pair sums, which exactly represents the order-statistic statement
and handles repeated values. -/

/-- Ordered-window reduction (concept `jis_term_73e55616c68e02e09fa349b5`;
local reduction used by source lines 120-124 for increasing sequences).

An already ordered window `a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d` is a Van der Laan window if and
only if the largest term is the sum of the two smallest, `d = a + b`. -/

/-- Constant window characterization (concept `jis_term_73e55616c68e02e09fa349b5`).

A constant window `(k, k, k, k)` has largest value `k` and smallest pair sum
`k + k`, so it is a Van der Laan window iff `k = 0`. -/

A constant non-negative sequence is Van der Laan iff its value is zero; in
particular the identically zero sequence claimed as one alternative in the
source conjecture satisfies the predicate. -/
