# Laurent Power Series

This file formalizes properties of Laurent polynomials and Laurent power series,
following Section `\ref{sec.details.gf.laure}` of the source material.

## Overview

Laurent polynomials are formal sums `∑_{i ∈ ℤ} aᵢ xⁱ` where only finitely many coefficients
are nonzero. Laurent power series are formal sums where the sequence of negative-indexed
coefficients is essentially finite (i.e., only finitely many negative powers appear).

In Mathlib:
- Laurent polynomials are `LaurentPolynomial R` (notation `R[T;T⁻¹]`), implemented as
  `AddMonoidAlgebra R ℤ`
- Laurent series are `LaurentSeries R` (notation `R⸨X⸩`), implemented as `HahnSeries ℤ R`

## Main Results

### Laurent Polynomials (Theorem thm.fps.laure.laupol-ring)
- `LaurentPolynomial` forms a commutative `K`-algebra with `x` invertible
- Multiplication by `x` shifts coefficients: `x · a = (aₙ₋₁)_{n∈ℤ}` (Lemma lem.fps.laure.xa)
- For each `k ∈ ℤ`, we have `xᵏ = (δᵢ,ₖ)_{i∈ℤ}` (Proposition prop.fps.laure.xk)
- Every Laurent polynomial can be written as `∑ aᵢ xⁱ` (`eq_sum_T`)

### Laurent Series (Theorem thm.fps.laure.lauser-ring)
- `LaurentSeries` forms a commutative `K`-algebra with `x` invertible
- The product of two Laurent series is again a Laurent series (closure under multiplication)
- Every Laurent series can be written as `∑_{i∈ℤ} aᵢ xⁱ` (Proposition prop.fps.laure.a=sumaixi)

/-- **Definition of Laurent polynomials** (Definition def.fps.laure.laupol)

A Laurent polynomial over K is an essentially finite family (aₙ)_{n∈ℤ}, represented
in Mathlib as `LaurentPolynomial K = AddMonoidAlgebra K ℤ = ℤ →₀ K`.

This definition captures the key property: only finitely many coefficients are nonzero. -/
