# Analysis I, Section 11.8: The Riemann-Stieltjes integral

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:
- Definition of `α_length`.
- The piecewise constant Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
- The full Riemann-Stieltjes integral.

{open Set}

Technical notes:
- In Lean it is more convenient to make definitions such as `α_length` and the Riemann-Stieltjes
  integral totally defined, thus assigning "junk" values to the cases where the definition is
  not intended to be applied. For the definition of `α_length`, the definition is intended to be
  applied in contexts where left and right limits exist, and the function is extended by
  constants to the left and right of its intended domain of definition; for instance, if a
  function `x` `f` is defined on {lean}`Icc 0 1`, then it is intended that `f x = f 1` for all `x ≥ 1`
  and `f x = f 0` for all `x ≤ 0`; in particular, at a right endpoint, the value of a function
  is intended to agree with its right limit, and similarly for the left endpoint, although we
  do not enforce this in our definition of `α_length`. (For functions defined on open intervals,
  the extension is immaterial.)
- The notion of `α_length` and piecewise constant Riemann-Stieltjes integral is intended for
  situations where left and right limits exist, such as for monotone functions or continuous
  functions, though technically they make sense without these hypotheses. The full Riemann-Stieltjes
  integral is intended for functions that are of bounded variation, though we shall restrict
  attention to the special case of monotone increasing functions for the most part.
