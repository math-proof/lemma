# Analysis I, Section 3.5: Cartesian products

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Ordered pairs and n-tuples.
- Cartesian products and n-fold products.
- Finite choice.
- Connections with Mathlib counterparts such as {name}`Set.pi` and {name}`Set.prod`.

  {given -show}`x : X, y : Y`
  Connections with the Mathlib set product, which consists of Lean pairs like {lean}`(x, y)`
  equipped with a proof that {name}`x` is in the left set, and {name}`y` is in the right set.
  Lean pairs like {lean}`(x, y)` are similar to our {name}`OrderedPair`, but more general.
