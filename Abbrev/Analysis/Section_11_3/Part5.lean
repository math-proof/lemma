# Analysis I, Section 11.3: Upper and lower Riemann integrals

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:
- The upper and lower Riemann integral; the Riemann integral.
- Upper and lower Riemann sums.
