# Analysis I, Section 3.4: Images and inverse images

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Images and inverse images of (Mathlib) functions, within the framework of Section 3.1 set
  theory. (The Section 3.3 functions are now deprecated and will not be used further.)
- Connection with Mathlib's image {syntax term}`f '' S` and preimage {syntax term}`f ⁻¹' S` notions.
