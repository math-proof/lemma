# Analysis I, Section 3.1: Fundamentals (of set theory)

In this section we set up a version of Zermelo-Frankel set theory (with atoms) that tries to be
as faithful as possible to the original text of Analysis I, Section 3.1. All numbering refers to
the original text.

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- A type `Chapter3.SetTheory.Set` of sets
- A type `Chapter3.SetTheory.Object` of objects
- An axiom that every set is (or can be coerced into) an object
- The empty set {syntax term}`∅`, singletons {syntax term}`{y}`, and pairs {syntax term}`{y,z}` (and more general finite tuples), with
  their attendant axioms
- Pairwise union {syntax term}`X ∪ Y`, and their attendant axioms
- Coercion of a set `A` to its associated type `A.toSubtype`, which is a subtype of `Object`, and
  basic API.  (This is a technical construction needed to make the Zermelo-Frankel set theory
  compatible with the dependent type theory of Lean.)
- The specification `A.specify P` of a set `A` and a predicate `P: A.toSubtype → Prop` to the
  subset of elements of `A` obeying `P`, and the axiom of specification.
  TODO: somehow implement set builder elaboration for this.
- The replacement `A.replace hP` of a set `A` via a predicate
  `P: A.toSubtype → Object → Prop` obeying a uniqueness condition
  `∀ x y y', P x y ∧ P x y' → y = y'`, and the axiom of replacement.
- A bijective correspondence between the Mathlib natural numbers `ℕ` and a set
  `Chapter3.Nat : Chapter3.Set` (the axiom of infinity).
- Axioms of regularity, power set, and union (used in later sections of this chapter, but not
  required here)
- Connections with Mathlib's notion of a {name}`Set`

The other axioms of Zermelo-Frankel set theory are discussed in later sections.

Some technical notes:
- Mathlib of course has its own notion of a {name}`Set` (or more precisely, a type `Set X` associated to
  each type `X`), which is not compatible with the notion `Chapter3.Set` defined here,
  though we will try to make the notations match as much as possible.  This causes some notational
  conflict: for instance, one may need to explicitly specify `(∅:Chapter3.Set)` instead of just {syntax term}`∅`
  to indicate that one is using the `Chapter3.Set` version of the empty set, rather than the
  Mathlib version of the empty set, and similarly for other notation defined here.
- In Analysis I, we chose to work with an "impure" set theory, in which there could be more
  `Object`s than just `Set`s.  In the type theory of Lean, this requires treating `Chapter3.Set`
  and `Chapter3.Object` as distinct types. Occasionally this means we have to use a coercion
  `(X: Chapter3.Object)` of a `Chapter3.Set` `X` to make into a `Chapter3.Object`: this is
  mostly needed when manipulating sets of sets.
- Strictly speaking, a set `X:Set` is not a type; however, we will coerce sets to types, and
  specifically to a subtype of `Object`.  A similar coercion is in place for Mathlib's
  formalization of sets.
- After this chapter is concluded, the notion of a `Chapter3.SetTheory.Set` will be deprecated in
  favor of the standard Mathlib notion of a {name}`Set` (or more precisely of the type `Set X` of a set
  in a given type `X`).  However, due to various technical incompatibilities between set theory
  and type theory, we will not attempt to create a full equivalence between these two
  notions of sets. (As such, this makes this entire chapter optional from the point of view of
  the rest of the book, though we retain it for pedagogical purposes.)
